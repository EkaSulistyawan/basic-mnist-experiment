# Very (very) Basic MNIST Experiment
Selected assignment during my lesson in Computer Vision. I decided to share it with you coz I learned a lot in the process. 

## Subfile assignment1.ipynb
- Be familiarized with the PyTorch ecosystem.
- Building a basic vision model for classification, five networks are modified from the LeNet model. Check out here [LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet).
- What was learned?
  - It's better to have a longer fully-connected layer than a longer convolutional layer.
  - The LeNet requires a larger dataset. Pruned models are more efficient owing to higher performance on smaller datasets.
