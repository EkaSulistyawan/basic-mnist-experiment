# Very (very) Basic MNIST Experiment
Selected assignment during my lesson in Computer Vision. I decided to share it with you coz I learned a lot in the process. 

# What to expect?
- Be familiarized with the Torchvision ecosystem.
- Building a basic vision model for classification, five networks are modified from the LeNet model. Check out here [LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet).
- Exploring augmentation, a technique to increase the number of acquisitions.
